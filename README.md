# ConsoleJack

This is a very simple BlackJack game for the Windows Command-Prompt.  The UI is pretty messy, I wrote it over the course of a day several years ago to to practice console and string manipulation.

The shuffle algorithm and Card/Deck system might be adaptable for someone making a card game in a more powerful engine.
