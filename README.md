# ConsoleJack

This is a very simple BlackJack game for the Windows Command-Prompt.  The UI code is pretty messy, it wasn't really intended to be re-cycled as I wrote it over the course of a day several years ago to to practice console and string manipulation.

The shuffle algorithm and Card/Deck system might still be adaptable for a learner who wants a porting challenge to make a card game in a more powerful engine.
